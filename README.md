# snakeatspam
This was a project, also known as Spampede, completed in HM CSCI060 (Principles of Computer Science) Fall 2019 under Professor Breeden.

Using Java, OOP, Datastructures, and BFS, a snake (a linked list) searches for spam on the game board either controlled by the player or on AI-mode.
Code is found in the master branch. The project is best run using Eclipse.

Welcome to the snakeatspam game, or more formally known as Spampede by CS60 students.

You're welcome to play by controlling the snake to eat spam with your keyboard, or placing the snake on AI mode to find and discover the spam on its own. (The snake is very smart and doest this using Breadth First Search).

As you play, hopefully you'll be entertained by:
-the colorful board and snake
-the spam counter
-and the 3 lives that you get as a snake (the game will reset after you die, until you've died three times)

An most importantly, you can play to the tune of Doja Cat's "Juicy" which was a TikTok hit when this was being created

Have fun and thanks for playing!
