# snakeatspam
This was a project, also known as Spampede, completed in HM CSCI60 (Principles of Computer Science) Fall 2019 under Professor Breeden.

Using Java, OOP, and BFS, a snake searches for spam on the game board either controlled by the player or on AI-mode.
Code is found in the master branch. The project is best run using Eclipse.
