Spampede README.txt

Welcome to the snakeatspam game, or more formally known as Spampede by CS60 students.

You're welcome to play by controlling the snake to eat spam with your keyboard, or placing the snake on AI mode to find and discover the spam on its own. (The snake is very smart and doest this using Breadth First Search).

As you play, hopefully you'll be entertained by:
-the colorful board and snake
-the spam counter
-and the 3 lives that you get as a snake (the game will reset after you die, until you've died three times)

An most importantly, you can play to the tune of Doja Cat's "Juicy" which was a TikTok hit when this was being created

Have fun and thanks for playing!
